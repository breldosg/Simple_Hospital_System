5. üß∞ Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
Step 1: Incident Detection
Real-time monitoring tools

Auto-alert system (email/SMS)

Manual incident reporting (admin dashboard or phone)

Step 2: Initial Response
Triage by technical team

Secure affected systems

Prevent further damage or intrusion

Step 3: Data Recovery
Restore latest verified backup

Validate data integrity

Rollback incomplete/failed transactions

Step 4: System Restoration
Reboot core services

Reconnect integrations (e.g., SMS, email gateways)

Test before giving hospitals access

Step 5: Communication
Notify affected hospitals within 1 hour

Provide recovery status updates

Share post-incident report

6. ‚è±Ô∏è Recovery Time & Data Objectives
| Metric                             | Target                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**  | ‚â§ 6 hours (cloud) / ‚â§ 24 hours (local install) |
| **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)** | ‚â§ 24 hours data loss (max)                     |
| **Uptime Commitment**              | 99.5% monthly (cloud service)                  |


7. üß™ Testing & Validation
Quarterly disaster recovery simulations

Annual audit of backup integrity

Random data restore tests

Local systems must verify their own backup setups (with our assistance if subscribed)

8. ü§ù Roles & Responsibilities
| Role                        | Responsibility                               |

Manual paper fallback process for emergencies

Optional: Local system support contract for on-site recovery

10. üîê Security During Disaster Events
Data encrypted during backup, transit, and restore
