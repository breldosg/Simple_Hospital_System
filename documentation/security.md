# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Simple Hospital System to protect sensitive medical data and ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Authentication System

### JWT Implementation
- Token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens
- Tokens are signed with a secure secret key
- Token expiration set to 24 hours
- Refresh token mechanism for extended sessions

### Cookie Security
```javascript
Cookie Configuration:
{
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
  sameSite: 'strict',
  maxAge: 86400000 // 24 hours
}
```

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Minimum password requirements:
  - 8 characters minimum
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- Password reset functionality with secure tokens

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

1. **User Roles**
   - Administrator
   - Doctor
   - Nurse
   - Pharmacist
   - Laboratory Technician
   - Radiologist
   - Receptionist
   - Billing Staff

2. **Permission Levels**
   - Read
   - Write
   - Update
   - Delete
   - Special (for specific operations)

3. **Resource Access Matrix**
```
Resource Type | Admin | Doctor | Nurse | Pharmacist
-------------|--------|---------|--------|------------
Patient Data |  CRUD  |   RU    |   RU   |    R
Prescriptions|   R    |   CRUD  |   R    |    RU
Lab Results  |   R    |   CRUD  |   R    |    -
Billing Info |  CRUD  |    R    |   -    |    -
```

## Data Protection

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are sanitized
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- File upload validation
  - Allowed file types
  - Maximum file size
  - Malware scanning

### API Security
1. **Rate Limiting**
   ```javascript
   Limits:
   - Authenticated: 100 requests/minute
   - Unauthenticated: 20 requests/minute
   ```

2. **Request Validation**
   - Request size limits
   - Content-Type validation
   - Origin validation

3. **Response Headers**
   ```
   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   X-Frame-Options: DENY
   X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
   ```

### File System Security
1. **Upload Directory**
   - Outside web root
   - Randomized file names
   - File type verification
   - Virus scanning

2. **Access Control**
   - Directory listing disabled
   - Proper file permissions
   - Access through authenticated API only

## Audit Trail

### Logging
1. **System Logs**
   - Authentication attempts
   - Authorization failures
   - System errors
   - Critical operations

2. **User Activity Logs**
   - Data access
   - Modifications
   - File downloads
   - Report generation

### Monitoring
1. **Real-time Alerts**
   - Multiple failed login attempts
   - Unusual access patterns
   - System errors
   - Security breaches

2. **Regular Audits**
   - Access patterns review
   - Permission changes
   - System configuration changes
   - Security incident review

## Compliance

### Healthcare Regulations
- HIPAA compliance measures
- Data privacy requirements
- Patient data protection
- Audit requirements

### Data Retention
1. **Storage Policies**
   - Patient data retention periods
   - Backup retention
   - Log retention
   - Audit trail retention

2. **Data Disposal**
   - Secure deletion methods
   - Archive procedures
   - Hardware disposal

## Incident Response
